## Project Description

VoiceVerify is an advanced AI-powered voice detection system that instantly identifies whether an audio clip contains human or synthetic (AI-generated) speech. In an era where AI voice cloning poses significant threats to media authenticity, legal evidence, and identity security, VoiceVerify provides forensic-level accuracy in voice authentication.

### Key Features:
- ⚡ **Instant Analysis** - Results in seconds with optimized AI pipeline
- 🎯 **High Accuracy** - Advanced multimodal AI model detects subtle artifacts
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support** - Works with multiple languages including Indian languages
- 🔒 **Privacy First** - Audio processed in-memory, never stored
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on all devices

### Technical Innovation:
- **Triple-Layer Detection**: Spectro-temporal analysis, prosodic mapping, and artifact detection
- **Modern Architecture**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, Google Gemini AI
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant voice classification with confidence scoring
- **Privacy-Focused**: Zero data retention, in-memory processing only

## Problem Statement

The rapid advancement of AI voice synthesis technology has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic human speech and AI-generated audio. This creates significant risks for:

- Media verification and journalism integrity
- Legal evidence authenticity in court proceedings
- Voice-based authentication systems security
